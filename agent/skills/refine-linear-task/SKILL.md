# Linear Task Refiner

Analyze and refine Linear task descriptions to improve clarity, completeness, and actionability through AI-assisted enhancement.

## When to Activate

- User wants to refine a Linear task
- User mentions improving task descriptions
- User asks to make a task clearer or more actionable
- User wants to add acceptance criteria to a task
- User mentions Linear issue refinement

## Overview

This skill takes a Linear issue identifier and refines its description by:

1. **Analyzing** the current task description for gaps and ambiguities
2. **Researching** relevant codebase context to inform the refinement
3. **Generating** an improved description with clear structure
4. **Presenting** the changes for user approval
5. **Updating** the Linear issue (with user consent)

## Inputs

Parse from request:

- **issue_identifier**: The Linear issue ID (e.g., "DEV-123", "dai-456")
- **--focus**: Optional focus for refinement (security, performance, testing, accessibility)
- **--update**: Auto-update after approval (default: false)

## Quick Process

### Phase 1: Fetch and Analyze Current Task

1. **Fetch Issue Details** via Linear MCP tools
2. **Display Current State**: Show issue details and description
3. **Analyze for Gaps**: Evaluate against criteria:
   - Clarity: Is the problem/goal clearly stated?
   - Context: Is there sufficient background information?
   - Scope: Are boundaries clearly defined?
   - Acceptance Criteria: Are success conditions defined?
   - Technical Details: Are implementation hints provided?
   - Dependencies: Are related tasks/blockers mentioned?

### Phase 2: Research Codebase Context

If the task relates to existing code:

1. **Identify Relevant Areas**: Search for mentioned files, functions, components
2. **Gather Technical Context**: Use Explore agent for patterns, tests, architecture
3. **Summarize Findings**: Document relevant files, patterns, considerations

### Phase 3: Generate Refined Description

Create comprehensive, well-structured description:

- **Problem Statement**: Clear, specific description of what and why
- **Context**: Background information, related decisions
- **Scope**: In-scope and out-of-scope items explicitly listed
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, testable success conditions
- **Technical Notes**: Implementation hints, relevant patterns
- **Dependencies**: Related tasks, blockers
- **References**: Documentation, design docs, related issues

### Phase 4: Present and Confirm

1. **Show Comparison**: Clear before/after comparison
2. **Summarize Improvements**: List specific enhancements made
3. **Request Approval**: Approve, Edit, or Cancel

### Phase 5: Update Linear (with approval)

1. **Update Issue Description** via Linear MCP
2. **Add Comment** (optional): Note the refinement
3. **Confirm Success**: Provide issue URL

## Focus Areas

### `--focus security`

- Analyze for security implications
- Add security-related acceptance criteria
- Note potential vulnerabilities or risks

### `--focus performance`

- Consider performance impact
- Add performance-related acceptance criteria
- Include benchmarks or targets

### `--focus testing`

- Emphasize test requirements
- Add test-specific acceptance criteria
- Note edge cases to cover

### `--focus accessibility`

- Consider a11y implications
- Add accessibility acceptance criteria
- Reference WCAG guidelines if applicable

## Output Format

Return structured summary:

- **Issue**: Identifier and title
- **Status**: Updated / Not Updated
- **Improvements Made**: List of specific improvements
- **Gap Analysis Summary**: Before/after comparison table
- **Next Steps**: Review, assign, begin implementation

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Context**: Always fetch and display current state first
2. **Research Before Refining**: Use codebase exploration for accuracy
3. **Be Specific**: Replace vague language with concrete, actionable items
4. **Make Criteria Testable**: Each acceptance criterion should be verifiable
5. **Respect Original Intent**: Enhance and clarify, don't fundamentally change
6. **Note Assumptions**: Explicitly note any assumptions made

## Examples

```
"Refine Linear task DEV-123"
"Improve the description for DAI-456"
"Make task DEV-789 more actionable with acceptance criteria"
"Refine DEV-104 with focus on security"
```

## Error Handling

- **Issue Not Found**: Verify identifier, access, and deletion status
- **No Linear Access**: Check MCP server config and API key
- **Update Failed**: Show error, offer manual copy option

## Integration

Works well with implementation workflow:

1. **Refine**: `/refine-linear-task DEV-123` - Clarify what needs to be done
2. **Explore**: Understand the codebase
3. **Plan**: Create implementation plan
4. **Execute**: Implement the solution
