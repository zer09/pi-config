Excluding search results that match a qualifier

In a browser, the GitHub search syntax supports excluding results that match a search qualifier
by prefixing the qualifier with a hyphen. For example, to search for issues that
do not have the label "bug", you would use `-label:bug` as a search qualifier.

`gh` supports this syntax in `gh search` as well, but it requires extra
command line arguments to avoid the hyphen being interpreted as a command line flag because it begins with a hyphen.

On Unix-like systems, you can use the `--` argument to indicate that
the arguments that follow are not a flag, but rather a query string. For example:

$ gh search issues -- "my-search-query -label:bug"

On PowerShell, you must use both the `--%` argument and the `--` argument to
produce the same effect. For example:

$ gh --% search issues -- "my search query -label:bug"
