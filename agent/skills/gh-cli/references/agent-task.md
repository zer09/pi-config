ARGUMENTS
  A task can be identified as argument in any of the following formats:
  - by pull request number, e.g. "123"; or
  - by session ID, e.g. "12345abc-12345-12345-12345-12345abc"; or
  - by URL, e.g. "https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/pull/123/agent-sessions/12345abc-12345-12345-12345-12345abc";
  
  Identifying tasks by pull request is not recommended for non-interactive use cases as
  there may be multiple tasks for a given pull request that require disambiguation.

EXAMPLES
  # List your most recent agent tasks
  $ gh agent-task list
  
  # Create a new agent task on the current repository
  $ gh agent-task create "Improve the performance of the data processing pipeline"
