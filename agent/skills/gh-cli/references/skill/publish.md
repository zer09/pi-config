## Manual

```text
Validate a local repository's skills against the Agent Skills specification
and publish them by creating a GitHub release.

Skills are discovered using the same conventions as install:

  - `skills/*/SKILL.md`
  - `skills/{scope}/*/SKILL.md`
  - `*/SKILL.md` (root-level)
  - `plugins/{scope}/skills/*/SKILL.md`

Validation checks include:

  - Skill names match the strict agentskills.io naming rules
  - Each skill name matches its directory name
  - Required frontmatter fields (name, description) are present
  - allowed-tools is a string, not an array
  - Install metadata (`metadata.github-*`) is stripped if present

After validation passes, publish will interactively guide you through:

  - Adding the `agent-skills` topic to the repository
  - Choosing a version tag (semver recommended)
  - Creating a GitHub release with auto-generated notes

Use `--dry-run` to validate without publishing.
Use `--tag` to publish non-interactively with a specific tag.
Use `--fix` to automatically strip install metadata from committed files
without publishing. Review and commit the changes, then run publish again.

  --fix          Auto-fix issues where possible without publishing (e.g. strip install metadata)
