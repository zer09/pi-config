```text
Install agent skills from a GitHub repository or local directory into
your local environment. Skills are placed in a host-specific directory
at either project scope (inside the current git repository) or user
scope (in your home directory, available everywhere).

A wide range of AI coding agents are supported, including GitHub
Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, Amp,
Goose, Junie, OpenCode, Windsurf, and many more.

  - GitHub Copilot (github-copilot)
  - Claude Code (claude-code)
  - Cursor (cursor)
  - Codex (codex)
  - Gemini CLI (gemini-cli)
  - Antigravity (antigravity)

Use `--agent` and `--scope` to control placement, or `--dir` for a
custom directory. The default scope is `project`, and the default
agent is `github-copilot` (when running non-interactively).

At project scope, several agents (including GitHub Copilot, Cursor,
Codex, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, Amp, Cline, OpenCode, and Warp) share
the `.agents/skills` directory. If you select multiple hosts that
resolve to the same destination, each skill is installed there only once.

The first argument is a GitHub repository in `OWNER/REPO` format.
Use `--from-local` to install from a local directory instead.
Local skills are auto-discovered using the same conventions as remote
repositories, and files are copied (not symlinked) with local-path
tracking metadata injected into frontmatter.

Skills are discovered automatically using the `skills/*/SKILL.md` convention
defined by the Agent Skills specification, including when the `skills/`
directory is nested under a prefix (e.g. `terraform/code-generation/skills/...`).
For more information on the specification,
see: https://agentskills.io/specification

The skill argument can be a name, a namespaced name (`author/skill`),
or an exact path within the repository (`skills/author/skill` or
`skills/author/skill/SKILL.md`).

Performance tip: when installing from a large repository with many
skills, providing an exact path instead of a skill name avoids a
full tree traversal of the repository, making the install significantly faster.

When a skill name is provided without a version, the CLI resolves the
version in this order:

  1. Latest tagged release in the repository
  2. Default branch HEAD

To pin to a specific version, either append `@VERSION` to the skill
name or use the `--pin` flag. The version is resolved as a git tag or commit SHA.

Installed skills have source tracking metadata injected into their
frontmatter. This metadata identifies the source repository and
enables `gh skill update` to detect changes.

When run interactively, the command prompts for any missing arguments.
When run non-interactively, `repository` and a skill name are
required.


USAGE
  gh skill install <repository> [<skill[@version]>] [flags]

ALIASES
  gh skill add, gh skills add

FLAGS
      --agent string        Target agent (see supported values above)
      --allow-hidden-dirs   Include skills in hidden directories (e.g. .claude/skills/, .agents/skills/)
      --dir string          Install to a custom directory (overrides --agent and --scope)
  -f, --force               Overwrite existing skills without prompting
      --from-local          Treat the argument as a local directory path instead of a repository
      --pin string          Pin to a specific git tag or commit SHA
      --scope string        Installation scope: {project|user} (default "project")
      --upstream            Install from the upstream source when a re-published skill is detected

INHERITED FLAGS
  --help   Show help for command

EXAMPLES
  # Interactive: choose repo, skill, and agent
  $ gh skill install
  
  # Choose a skill from the repo interactively
  $ gh skill install github/awesome-copilot
  
  # Install a specific skill
  $ gh skill install github/awesome-copilot git-commit
  
  # Install a specific version
  $ gh skill install github/awesome-copilot git-commit@v1.2.0
  
  # Install from a large namespaced repo by path (efficient, skips full discovery)
  $ gh skill install github/awesome-copilot skills/monalisa/code-review
  
  # Install from a local directory
  $ gh skill install ./my-skills-repo --from-local
  
  # Install a specific local skill
  $ gh skill install ./my-skills-repo git-commit --from-local
  
  # Install for Claude Code at user scope
  $ gh skill install github/awesome-copilot git-commit --agent claude-code --scope user
  
  # Pin to a specific git ref
  $ gh skill install github/awesome-copilot git-commit --pin v2.0.0
  
  # Install skills from hidden directories (e.g. .claude/skills/)
  $ gh skill install owner/repo --allow-hidden-dirs
