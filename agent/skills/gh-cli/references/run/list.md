## Manual

```text
List recent workflow runs.

Note that providing the `workflow_name` to the `-w` flag will not fetch disabled workflows.
Also pass the `-a` flag to fetch disabled workflow runs using the `workflow_name` and the `-w` flag.

Runs created by organization and enterprise ruleset workflows will not display a workflow name due to GitHub API limitations.

To see runs associated with a pull request, users should run `gh pr checks`.

For more information about output formatting flags, see `gh help formatting`.
