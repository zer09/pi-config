```text
View changes in a pull request.

Without an argument, the pull request that belongs to the current branch
is selected.

With `--web` flag, open the pull request diff in a web browser instead.

Use `--exclude` to filter out files matching a glob pattern. The pattern
uses forward slashes as path separators on all platforms. You can repeat
the flag to exclude multiple patterns.

      --name-only          Display only names of changed files
      --patch              Display diff in patch format
  -w, --web                Open the pull request diff in the browser
