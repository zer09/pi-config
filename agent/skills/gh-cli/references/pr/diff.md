```text
View changes in a pull request.

Without an argument, the pull request that belongs to the current branch
is selected.

With `--web` flag, open the pull request diff in a web browser instead.

Use `--exclude` to filter out files matching a glob pattern. The pattern
uses forward slashes as path separators on all platforms. You can repeat
the flag to exclude multiple patterns.

By default, terminal escape sequences in the diff are neutralized, since
they could manipulate your terminal. Pass `--allow-escape-sequences` to
print the diff verbatim, for example when piping a patch to another program.


USAGE
  gh pr diff [<number> | <url> | <branch>] [flags]

FLAGS
      --allow-escape-sequences   Allow printing terminal escape sequences
      --color string             Use color in diff output: {always|never|auto} (default "auto")
  -e, --exclude patterns         Exclude files matching glob patterns from the diff
      --name-only                Display only names of changed files
      --patch                    Display diff in patch format
  -w, --web                      Open the pull request diff in the browser

INHERITED FLAGS
      --help                     Show help for command
  -R, --repo [HOST/]OWNER/REPO   Select another repository using the [HOST/]OWNER/REPO format
