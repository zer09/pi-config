## Summary

Exit codes used by gh

## Manual

```text
gh follows normal conventions regarding exit codes.

- If a command completes successfully, the exit code will be 0

- If a command fails for any reason, the exit code will be 1

- If a command is running but gets cancelled, the exit code will be 2

- If a command requires authentication, the exit code will be 4

NOTE: It is possible that a particular command may have more exit codes, so it is a good
practice to check documentation for the command if you are relying on exit codes to
control some behavior.
