## Manual

```text
Search for pull requests on GitHub.

The command supports constructing queries using the GitHub search syntax,
using the parameter and qualifier flags, or a combination of the two.

GitHub search syntax is documented at:
<https://docs.github.com/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests>

On supported GitHub hosts, advanced issue search syntax can be used in the
`--search` query. For more information about advanced issue search, see:
<https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/filtering-and-searching-issues-and-pull-requests#building-advanced-filters-for-issues>

For more information on handling search queries containing a hyphen, run `gh search --help`.

For more information about output formatting flags, see `gh help formatting`.
