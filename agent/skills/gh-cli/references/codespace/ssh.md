## Manual

```text
The `ssh` command is used to SSH into a codespace. In its simplest form, you can
run `gh cs ssh`, select a codespace interactively, and connect.

The `ssh` command will automatically create a public/private ssh key pair in the
`~/.ssh` directory if you do not have an existing valid key pair. When selecting the
key pair to use, the preferred order is:

1. Key specified by `-i` in `<ssh-flags>`
2. Automatic key, if it already exists
3. First valid key pair in ssh config (according to `ssh -G`)
4. Automatic key, newly created

The `ssh` command also supports deeper integration with OpenSSH using a `--config`
option that generates per-codespace ssh configuration in OpenSSH format.
Including this configuration in your `~/.ssh/config` improves the user experience
of tools that integrate with OpenSSH, such as Bash/Zsh completion of ssh hostnames,
remote path completion for `scp/rsync/sshfs`, `git` ssh remotes, and so on.

Once that is set up (see the second example below), you can ssh to codespaces as
if they were ordinary remote hosts (using `ssh`, not `gh cs ssh`).

Note that the codespace you are connecting to must have an SSH server pre-installed.
If the docker image being used for the codespace does not have an SSH server,
install it in your `Dockerfile` or, for codespaces that use Debian-based images,
you can add the following to your `devcontainer.json`:

	"features": {
		"ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/sshd:1": {
			"version": "latest"
		}
	}
