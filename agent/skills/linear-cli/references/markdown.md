Description:

  Linear-flavored Markdown: mentions and collapsible sections

  These rules apply to comment bodies, issue descriptions, document content,
  project overviews, and status update bodies.

  MENTIONS

  A resource's plain Linear URL becomes a linked mention. A literal `@name`, an
  `@[Name](id)`, or a Markdown link such as `[Name](url)` does not — it stays
  plain text and notifies nobody. Put the bare URL in the body:

  https://linear.app/acme/profiles/someuser can you take a look?

  RESOLVING PEOPLE

  Look the person up in the relevant team first. The team can usually be
  inferred from the issue identifier or the current directory:

  linear team members ENG --json

  Paste the selected member's `url` field verbatim. If the intended person is
  not a member of that team, stop and confirm before searching the whole
  workspace with `linear user list --json`; mentioning someone outside the team
  is likely accidental.

  To mention an issue, use its URL the same way:

  linear issue url ENG-123

  COLLAPSIBLE SECTIONS

  Open a section with `+++ [title]` and close it with `+++`:

  +++ [Server log]

  Markdown content that is initially hidden.

  +++

  The square brackets around the title and the closing `+++` are both required.

Options:

  -h, --help           - Show this help.
  --workspace  <slug>  - Target workspace (uses credentials)
```
